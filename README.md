# The Legend of Tilde
## (front-end app)

This is the front-end repo for my final project at Galvanize. It is completely decoupled from the [server app](https://www.github.com/skuttleman/capstone-server), and uses JWT to maintain authorization through Google OAuth.

This is a 2 player cooperative puzzle game. Players must communicate what they see and what they need from the other player through rudimentary symbols in order to solve the puzzles. It uses socket.io for game update notification when the player is online, or the Twilio API for SMS notification when the player is offline.
